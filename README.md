# Improving Phylogenetics Content on Wikipedia Day

Much of the content on phylogenetics and comparative methods on wikipedia is inaccurate, out of date, or incomplete. [I](http://dunnlab.org) complained [about it](https://twitter.com/caseywdunn/status/652569124804120576), and [Matthew Pennell](http://t.co/7pYWgWoP7d) said we should do something [about it](https://twitter.com/mwpennell/status/652570046758191104).

Please save the date for **December 3, 2015** to work together to improve wikipedia articles on phylogenetics and comparative methods. By making a coordinated community push we can achieve greater consistency across a large number of pages.

In the mean time, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/caseywdunn/evowikipedia/issues) for this repository to flag pages (existing or that should exist but don't) that need attention. That way we can sit down with well defined objectives and clear priorities when the big edit day comes. 


Scope:

- The emphasis will be on concepts, including "tree thinking", and methods, rather than on revising phylogenetic relationships indicated in organism pages.
